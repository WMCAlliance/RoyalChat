# RoyalChat 0.2.0
---
This is the second rewrite that RoyalChat has gone through, and it's the best one so far. It adds many new features, most of them subtle. A major change is ~~**Factions**~~ support, which has been asked for many times over. Overall, it just works better. It's cleaner. It's faster. It's smarter. It's the new RoyalChat: 0.2.0.
